Welcome to the new RBMH Open Source blog. This blog will give you insights and detailed information about all our Open Source projects. 

The goal is to make more and more useful projects public available. We are also planning to launch new internal projects as fully Open Source from the very beginning (like Eventuate, which will be announced soon)

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to get in contact with us - ideally via mail to paul.urthaler@at.redbullmediahouse.com
