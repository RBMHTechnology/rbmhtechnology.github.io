We want to inform you that [Eventuate](http://rbmhtechnology.github.io/eventuate) - our toolkit for building applications composed of event-driven and event-sourced services - as well as [Calliope](https://github.com/RBMHTechnology/calliope) are now in **maintenance mode**.

Only critical bugs will be fixed, but there won't be any more feature development!
